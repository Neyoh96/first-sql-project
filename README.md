# First SQL Project

This repository contains my first SQL practice project.  
The purpose of this project is to understand the fundamentals of SQL, including database creation, table structure, and basic constraints.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a database and designed a table using SQL.  
The focus was on learning how data is structured and managed in a relational database.

---

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Create a database using SQL
- Create tables with appropriate data types
- Use PRIMARY KEY and AUTO_INCREMENT
- Apply NOT NULL constraints
- Work with DATE data types

---

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- MySQL

---

## Files in This Repository

- `sales.sql` (or your actual file name)  
  Contains SQL commands for creating the database and table.

---

## How to Run This Project

1. Open MySQL or any SQL-compatible database tool
2. Copy the SQL code from the `.sql` file
3. Execute the script to create the database and table

---

## Future Improvements

- Add INSERT queries to populate the table
- Write SELECT queries for data analysis
- Add more tables and relationships
- Practice JOINs and aggregate functions

## About Me

I am currently learning SQL as part of my journey into data analytics and IT-related roles.  
This project represents my first hands-on experience with SQL and database design.
